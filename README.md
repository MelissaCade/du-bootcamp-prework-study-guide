## Denver University Coding Bootcamp Study Guide - for Prework

I am starting a coding bootcamp, and want to have a place to keep my notes and useful information I'm learning. I simultaneously want to try out some of the things I'm learning, since I learn best by doing. To make it look how I wanted instead of the boilerplate design, I had to do a lot of independent research which helped me become more comfortable with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This Study Guide is intended to be a reference for myself. The various subjects I am studying are divided up with notes for each. I'm also running JavaScript, which you can see when you open the DevTools console.

## Credits

I used the prework tutorial for the DU Coding Bootcamp, as well as the linked reference guides.
